<h4>CMSMS Admin Permission Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>CMSMS Uses a system of named permissions. Access to these permissions determines a users ability to perform different functions in the CMSMS admin console.</li>
<li>The CMSMS core creates several permissions on installation <em>(occasionally permissions are added or deleted during an upgrade process)</em>. Non-core modules might create additional permissions.</li>
<li>Permissions are associated with user groups. An authorized user can adjust the permissions that are associated with certain member groups <em>(including the permission to change a group permissions)</em>. The <strong>Admin</strong> group is a special group. Members of this group will have all permissions.</li>
<li>Admin user accounts can be members of zero or more groups. It might be possible for a user account that is not a member of any groups to still perform various functionality <em>(please read about ownership and additional-editors in the Content Manager help, and Design Manager help).</em>. The first user account <em>(uid == 1)</em>, which is typically named &quot;Admin&quot; is a special user account and will have all permissions.</li>
</ul>
