<h3>What does this do?</h3>
  <p>The &quot;DesignManager&quot; module is a mechanism to comprehensively manage the various templates, stylesheets, and &quot;designs&quot; used in this website.  It provides convenient sorting, filtering, and organization mechanisms for these various primary elements.</p>

<h3>What is a &quot;Design&quot; ?</h3>
  <p>A &quot;Design&quot; is an entity that manages in one logical unit the various templates and stylesheets that are required for a particular look and feel on a website.</p>
  <p>The design contains a list of stylesheets, and manages the order of those stylesheets.  It also contains a list of templates <em>(of various types)</em> that are associated.   Designs can be exported to XML for sharing, and can be imported from XML.</p>

<h3>Templates Explained:</h3>
<p>A template is a collection of HTML and/or smarty code.  Templates are usually re-used multiple times on a website, and can include or inherit from other templates.  CMSMS provides numerous templates for various purposes.  These purposes include defining the structure of a web page, a navigation menu, or displaying news article summaries or details.<p>
<p>Each template must have a name that must be unique across the entire installation.  Additionally, each template is capable of having a description that allows providing human readable information and notes about the characteristics of the template.  You can optionally assign each template to a category to aide in quickly finding the template when edits are required.</p>
<p>Templates can optionally be associated with one or more designs.  This helps when needing to quickly find a template to edit.  As well, when exporting a design all the templates that are associated with the design will be exported.</p>
<p>Depending upon the template type <em>(see below)</em> A template can be set as the &quot;default&quot; for that type.  This functionality allows a module to find a template to use of an appropriate type if no template name is specified in the module tag, or via any other means.  For example, in a default installation the &quot;News Summary Sample&quot; template is the default template for the News default <em>(summary)</em> action.  Therefore calling <em>{News}</em> without specifying a template will use this template.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can select one or more admin user accounts, or admin user groups that have the ability to edit the template.  This gives the ability for restricted users to have limited access to some templates.  This might be useful for editing seasonal messages, or for modifying API keys or RSS feed URLS.</p>
<p>When templates are edited the user(s) selected syntax highlighter module will be used, assuming that a syntax highlighter module has been installed, and that the user has selected one from within his user preferences.</p>
<p>To call a template you can either specify the template name in a module call or explicitly call/include the template from another one with the <code>{include file='cms_template:&lt;template_name&gt;'}</code> syntax.  See the smarty {include} tag.  Additionally, for backwards compatibility purposes the <code>{global_content name='&lt;template_name&gt;'}</code> syntax still works.</p>

<h4>Template Types Explained:</h4>
<p>A template type loosely indicates the general purpose for the template.  Template types indicate the module or code that uses them, and a subtype.  For example two common template types are Core::Page indicating a template used by the core CMSMS system to structure a web page, and News::Summary indicating a template that the News module can use to create a summary listing.</p>
<p>Modules might create new template types on installation, and delete template types when they uninstall.  Most modules will delete all templates that are associated with its types when the module is uninstalled.</p>
<p>Template types can optionally contain a &quot;Prototype Template&quot;.  The prototype is used when creating a new template of that type.  For example, if you create a new template of type &quot;News::Detail&quot; the template will initially be filled with the prototype data from that type.  You can then change the template to your liking.</p>

<h3>Categories Explained:</h3>
<p>Templates can be associated with a single category merely as a method of organizing templates.  The DesignManager interface allows filtering types by category so that you can more easily find a template to edit.</p>

<h3>Stylesheets Explained:</h3>
<p>Stylesheets are text data that are stored in the database, and allow you to enter CSS data that is associated with zero or more designs.   Each stylesheet must have a unique name, has an optional description, and an optional media query.</p>
<p>You can associate each stylesheet with one or more designs, and specify the order of the stylesheets within the design.  When a content page is rendered, all of the stylesheets associated with the design will be combined, and output to a file to allow cashing by the browser.</p>
<p>Stylesheets can include smarty tags to allow doing logic within the stylesheet, or creating variables for reuse.  However instead of the normal { and } delimiters for smarty, the [[  and ]] delimiters are used.  For example:</p>
<pre><code><span style="color: blue;">[[&#36;red='#f00']]</span>
div.error {
   color: <span style="color: blue;">[[&#36;red]]</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the fact that stylesheets can be associated with zero or more designs, and/or called individually, and that stylesheets are combined and cached for all visitors, on the browser you must be careful when including smarty in templates.  Here are a few notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Never put server specific conditions, state conditions, time related, or page specific conditions into a stylesheet.</li>
    <li>You should assume that each stylesheet might be called individually, therefore smarty variable initialization should be placed in each stylesheet.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can include other templates inside of stylesheets using the <code>[[include file='cms_template::&lt;template_name&gt;']]</code> syntax as mentioned above however you must be aware of the change in smarty delimiters when processing stylesheets.  For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Stylesheet &quot;page&quot;<br/>
<pre><code><span style="color: blue;">[[include file='cms_template::my_colors']]</span>
body {
  background-color: <span style="color: blue;">[[&#36;my_background]]</span>;
  color: <span style="color: blue;">[[&#36;dflt_foreground]]</span>;
}
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Template: &quot;my_colors&quot;<br/>
<pre><code style="color: blue;">[[&#36;my_background='#fff']]
[[&#36;dflt_foreground='#000']]
</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>How do Content Pages Figure In?</h3>
<p>A template <em>(usually of type Core::Page)</em> is associated with each content page; this determines the content blocks and types of content blocks that are displayed in the editcontent page, and is used to determine how the content data is rendered as an HTML page. Additionally, a design is associated with each content page; this is used to determine the stylesheets that will be associated with the content page, and the order of those stylesheets.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory that the template associated with a content page be of type <em>Core::Page</em> as the template type is just used for organizational purposes.</p>

<h3>Importing and Exporting:</h3>
<p>DesignManager supports functionality to export a complete design (including templates, stylesheets, images, descriptions, and stylesheet order) to an XML format for use on another compatible CMS Made Simple website.  To export a design just click on the export icon on each design row on the Designs tab of the Design Manager admin panel.</p>
<p>The system will find all of the templates and stylesheets attached with a design, and for each template parse the template to find templates that are <strong>directly</strong> included via module calls or the include statement, and attach them.  It will also find links to local images, and include those files in the output xml file.  Similarly stylesheets are parsed for links to local images, and those images are included in the xml file.</p>

<h3>Template Locking:</h3>
<p>In order to prevent one designer or site developer from accidentally overwriting the work of another developer the DesignManager provides locking for templates.  When a site developer begins an edit session on a template the template is locked from edits from other developers.</p>
<p>Frequently, during the edit session the software pings the server to indicate that the developer is still working on the template.  If edit activity on the template ceases for a period of time, other developers can &quot;steal&quot; the lock.  Any unsaved changes by the first developer would be lost.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> At this time there is no locking functionality for stylesheets.</p>

<h3>Permissions and Visibility</h3>
<p>Numerous permissions are used to control access to the DesignManager module and its visibility in the CMSMS Admin navigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add Templates:
    <p>Logged in admin users with this permission have the ability to create new templates, but not to modify any existing templates <em>(that they do not otherwise have access to)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Modify Templates:
    <p>Logged in admin users with this permission have the ability to completely manage templates, including adding/editing/deleting.  They can also adjust the ownership, and additional editors of a template.</li>
  </li>
  <li>Manage Stylesheets:
    <p>Logged in admin users with this permission have the ability to completely manage stylesheets.  There is no functionality for ownership and additional editors of stylesheets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Manage Designs:
    <p>Logged in admin users with this permission have the ability to manage designs, including importing and exporting designs.  When importing a design the currently logged in user is marked as the owner for all new templates and stylesheets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Owner:
    <p>The owner of at least one template can view the module in the admin navigation, and edit or delete the templates he owns.  He can also grant additional editor rights to other users or admin groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Additional Editor:
    <p>An admin user who has been marked as an &quot;Additional Editor&quot; to one or more templates can view the module in the admin navigation, and edit the template including its description.  However he cannot change any associations of this template, delete the template or grant additional privileges to other users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Prior to the development of the DesignManager module in CMSMS 2.0 each separate section, and each module managed their own templates.  This meant that module management had different interfaces for each different type of template.  CMS Made Simple provided a table to store module templates, and various methods in the module API to allow interfacing with those templates.  However, each module was responsible for its own functionality for managing its templates.</p>

<h3>Compatibility:</h3>
<p>For compatibility purposes, the old method of managing module templates has been kept. <em>(This functionality is <strong>deprecated</strong> and might be removed at a future date.)</em>  Therefore until modules migrate their functionality to use the new APIs for managing template types, templates and stylesheets you might still have to visit numerous different admin pages and experience different interfaces to manage the templates of those modules.</p>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Design Manager is a module that unifies functionality for managing the layout of complete web pages or parts of them. It manages individual smarty templates and stylesheets, as well as their organisation into designs, and for templates, types and categories.</p>

<h3>What is a Design ?</h3>
<p>It is a container of sorts, providing an association between stylesheet(s) and template(s). It allows managing all of the stylesheets and templates required to implement a look and feel. Designs can be exported to a single file for sharing, and imported from such a file.</p>
<p>Each displayed content page is associated with a design, which determines the stylesheets to be used, and their order. Additionally, each displayed content page is associated with a template, but that template does not need to be included in the specified design.</p>
<p>Any template or stylesheet may belong to zero or more designs.</p>

<h3>What is a Template Type ?</h3>
<p>It is a way of organizing templates. Any template can belong to zero or one type(s). Some functionality might display lists of templates that are of a certain type to make selection easier. For example, the edit content page displays a list of &quot;Page&quot; templates.</p>
<p>A few standard template types are created during site installation. Third party modules might create others. Template type definitions normally have two parts, the Originator <em>(the module or functionality that created them)</em>, and the type name itself. i.e: Core::Page indicates a page template type created by the core. News::Summary is the name of the template type for news summary templates. Although site developers cannot create new template types they can specify the type for a template when adding or editing a template.</p>
<p>Most template types have a &quot;prototype&quot; template that is used to provide a skeleton layout creating a new template of that type.</p>
<p>Some template types (such as &quot;Core::Page&quot;) support a &quot;default template&quot; which is typically used by modules when a specific template is not named. Additionally, the default template of type &quot;Core::Page&quot; is used as the default template when creating a new content item of type &quot;Content&quot;.</p>
<p>The Design Manager admin interface allows filtering of templates by type, to easily find templates to edit or manage.</p>

<h4>Generic Templates <em>(formerly Global Content Blocks)</em></h4>
<p>One standard template type is &quot;Core::generic&quot;. This is a generic template that could be used for anything. It replaces &quot;Global Content Blocks&quot; <em>(GCB)</em> from prior versions of CMSMS.</p>

<h3>What is a Template Category ?</h3>
<p>It is another way of organizing templates. Any template can belong to zero or more categories, irrespective of its belonging to a type.</p>
<p>The Design Manager admin interface allows filtering of templates by category, to easily find templates to edit or manage.</p>

<h3>The Primary Interface</h3>
<p>The Design Manager Admin panel is located in the CMSMS Admin navigation as &quot;Design Manager&quot; under the &quot;Layout&quot; section.</p>
<p>The Design Manager Admin panel has numerous tabs. Each tab serves a particular purpose, and might require special privileges. Only a user with one of the required permissions <em>(or ownership/additional editor status on one or more templates)</em> will be able to see the design manager in the CMSMS admin console.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Templates Tab
    <p>The templates tab provides all of the functionality to conveniently and easily create and manage templates. It is visible to admin users with the &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission, or who are owners or additional editors of one or more templates.</p>
    <p>Some of the features of this tab include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A tabular format which displays summary information about each template, and provides convenient actions for working on templates individually, or en-masse.</li>
      <li>The ability to steal a locked template</li>
      <li>Advanced filtering</li>
      <li>Pagination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The Categories Tab
    <p>The categories tab is visible to all admin users with the &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission. It provides the ability to add, edit, delete, rename and re-order categories.</p>
    <p>When adding or editing a category it is possible to provide a description of the use of the category for reference purposes.</p>
  </li>

  <li>The Template Types Tab
    <p>This tab is visible to all admin users with the &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission. It provides the ability to edit information about the template type including the prototype template. And to create a new template of each type.</p>
  </li>

  <li>The Stylesheets Tab
    <p>This tab is visible to all admin users with the &quot;Manage Stylesheets&quot; permission. It provides the ability to create, delete, edit, and manage stylesheets.
      <p>
  </li>

  <li>The Designs Tab
    <p>This admin panel tab is visible to all admin users with the &quot;Manage Designs&quot; permission. <em>(Note: users with that permission and no others might not have access to the full functionality of this tab)</em>.
      <p>This tab provides the ability to import, export, create, edit, and delete designs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Templates</h3>
<p>The templates tab displays a list of templates matching the current filter <em>(if applied)</em> in a tabular format, with pagination. Each row of the table represents a single template. The columns of the table displays summary information about the template, and provides some ability to interact with it.</p>
<p>A dropdown providing the ability to switch between pages of templates that match the current filter will appear if more than one page of templates match the current filter.</p>
<p>An options menu exists providing the ability to adjust the current filter, or to create a new template <em>(depending upon permissions)</em>. The filter dialogue allows filtering the displayed templates by a number of criteria, as well as changing the page limit, and sorting of displayed templates.</p>
<h4>Table Columns:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Id:
    <p>This displays the unique numeric id for the template. Clicking on the link in this column will bring up the edit template form. Hovering over the link will display a tooltip with further information about the template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Name:
    <p>This displays a unique textual name for the template. Clicking on the link in this column will bring up the edit template form. Hovering over the link will display a tooltip with further information about the template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Type:
    <p>This displays the template type. Hovering over the type name will display a tooltip with further information about the template type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Design:
    <p>This column displays the design(s) that this template is associated with (if any). If the template is associated with multiple designs a tooltip will display a list of the first few designs that this template is associated with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Default:
    <p>This column displays an icon indicating if the template is the default for its type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Actions:
    <p>Depending upon user privileges there will be one or more icons displayed in this column to perform various actions on, or with the template:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit - Display a form to edit the contents and attributes of the template.</li>
      <li>Copy - Display a form to allow copying the selected template to a new name. For convenience a default new name will be provided.</li>
      <li>Delete - Display a form to allow deleting the selected template. Extra confirmation is required for this action as no checks are possible to see if the template is in use by any page, or recursively by any other template.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Multiselect:
    <p>This column (depending upon permissions) will display a checkbox allowing the selection of multiple templates to perform actions on all of them simultaneously.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Bulk Actions:</h4>
<p>This is a dropdown with options <em>(currently only delete)</em> to perform on multiple templates at one time. Use extreme caution when performing bulk actions as doing so could severely affect a working website.</p>
<h4>Editing Templates</h4>
<p>The edit template form is a complex form that allows management of all of the attributes of a template. For convenience the form is divided into numerous tabs.</p>
<p>This form supports the &quot;dirtyform&quot; functionality to reduce the chances of accidentally losing unsaved changes. Users will be notified if attempting to navigate away from this page if the template has not been saved.</p>
<p>This form locks the selected template so that other authorized editors will not have the ability to edit the template at the same time. This prevents somebody else from accidentally overwriting changes of another editor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name:
    <p>This text string uniquely identifies the template. The system will generate an error when saving the template if the name is already used on another template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Template Content:
    <p>This text area displays the actual smarty template. If a syntax highlighter module is installed, and enabled, and the user has enabled it in his settings, then it will be enabled in this area to provide advanced editing capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Description:
    <p>This text area provides the ability to describe the purpose of the templates, and notes that might be useful to editors in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Designs:
    <p>Depending upon permission levels, this tab will allow associating the template with zero or more designs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Advanced:
    <p>This tab displays fields that allow specifying the template category, its type, and whether it is the default template for the type. This tab is only available with the appropriate permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Permissions:
    <p>If the user account is the owner of the template, or has the &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permissions this tab will allow changing the ownership of the template, and/or specifying additional editors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Set All Pages:
    <p>Users with the &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission will see a button which will allow setting all content pages to use this template.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Categories</h3>
<p>The &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission is required to see this tab, and its associated actions.</p>
<p>The categories tab is a simple interface that allows creating, editing, removing and re-ordering categories. Categories can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.</p>
<p>Editing a category allows specifying a description for the category. The description is useful for keeping a note as to the purpose of the category.</p>
<h3>Managing Template Types</h3>
<p>The &quot;Modify Templates&quot; permission is required to see this tab, and its associated actions.</p>
<p>Users with sufficient privilege can adjust the prototype template, and description for each template type. The prototype template will be used as the default contents for the template when creating a new template of that type.</p>
<h3>Managing Stylesheets</h3>
<p>The stylesheets tab is available to users with the &quot;Manage Stylesheets&quot; permission. It displays a paginated list of all stylesheets matching the current filter <em>(if applied)</em> in a tabular format. Each row of the table represents a single stylesheet. The columns of the table displays summary information about the stylesheet and provides some ability to interact with it.</p>
<p>A dropdown providing the ability to switch between pages of stylesheets that match the current filter will appear if more than one page of stylesheets match the current filter.</p>
<p>An options menu exists providing the ability to adjust the current filter, or to create a new stylesheet <em>(depending upon permissions).</em> The filter dialogue allows filtering, sorting, and paginating the displayed stylesheets by a number of criteria.</p>
<h4>Table Columns:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Id:
    <p>This displays a link containing unique numeric id for the stylesheet. Clicking on this link will display the edit stylesheet form. Hovering over the link will display a tooltip with further information about the stylesheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Name:
    <p>This displays the unique textual name for the stylesheet as a link. Clicking on this link will display the edit stylesheet form. Hovering over the link will display a tooltip with further information about the stylesheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Design:
    <p>This column displays the design(s) that this stylesheet is associated with (if any). If the stylesheet is associated with multiple designs a tooltip will display a list of the first few designs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Modified Date:
    <p>This column displays the date that the stylesheet was last modified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Edit - Clicking on this icon will display the edit stylesheet form.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiselect:
    <p>This column displays a checkbox allowing the selection of multiple stylesheets to perform bulk actions on all of them simultaneously.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Bulk Actions:</h4>
<p>This mini form contains a dropdown with options <em>(currently only delete)</em> to perform on the selected stylesheets. Use extreme caution when performing bulk actions as doing so could severely affect a working website.</p>
<h4>Editing Stylesheets</h4>
<p>The edit stylesheet form is a complex form that allows management of all of the attributes of a stylesheet. for convenience the form is divided into numerous tabs. It supports the &quot;dirtyform&quot; functionality to reduce the chances of accidentally losing unsaved changes, and supports locking to prevent other authorized editors from accidentally overwriting changes.</p>
<p>Here are some of the attributes of a stylesheet that can be edited:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name:
    <p>This text string uniquely identifies the stylesheet. The system will generate an error when saving the stylesheet if the name is already used by another stylesheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Stylesheet Content:
    <p>This text area displays the actual CSS code. If a syntax highlighter module is installed, supports hi-lighting CSS code, is enabled, and the user has enabled it in his settings, then it will be enabled in this area to provide advanced editing capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Media Types <em style="color: red;">(deprecated)</em>:
    <p>This tab provides numerous checkbox allowing you to select media types to associate with the stylesheet. It is preferred to use media queries instead, and this functionality might be removed at a later date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Media Query:
    <p>This tab provides a text area where a media query can be associated with the stylesheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Description:
    <p>The text area in this tab provides the ability to describe the purpose of the stylesheets, and any notes that might be useful to editors in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Designs:
    <p>This tab provides the ability to associate the stylesheet with one or more designs. If any new design associations are detected this stylesheet will be placed at the end of the stylesheet list for that design.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Designs</h3>
<p>The designs tab is available to users with the &quot;Manage Designs&quot; permission. It displays a list of all of the known designs in a tabular format. Each row of the table represents a single design. The columns of the table displays summary information about the design and provides some ability to interact with it.</p>
<p>This tab does not provide filtering, pagination, or bulk actions as it is intended that the number of designs associated with a website should normally be kept small and manageable.</p>
<p>An options menu exists providing the ability to create a new design, or to import a design from XML format.</p>
<h4>Table Columns</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Id:
    <p>This column displays a link containing the unique numeric id for the design. Clicking on this link will display the edit design form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Name:
    <p>This column displays a link containing the name for the design. Clicking on this link will display the edit design form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Default:
    <p>This column an icon represent whether or not this design is the &quot;default&quot; design. The default design is selected first when creating a new content item of type &quot;Content Page&quot; and might be used for other purposes. Only one design can be the default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Actions:
    <p>This column displays various links and icons representing actions that can be performed with designs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit - Display a form to allow editing the design.</li>
      <li>Export - Export the design to an XML file that can be imported into other websites.</li>
      <li>Delete - Display a form that asks for confirmation about deleting the design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Editing Designs:</h4>
<p>The edit design form is a complex form that allows management of all of the attributes of a design. The form is divided into numerous tabs. Unlike editing stylesheets and templates, this form does not support &quot;dirtyform&quot; or locking functionality.</p>
<p>Some of the attributes of a design that can be edited are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name:
  </li>
  <li>Templates:
    <p>This tab allows selecting different templates to associate with the design. You can drag and drop templates between the &quot;Available Templates&quot; list and the &quot;Attached Templates&quot; list and to order templates within the attached list. At this time, ordering of templates within the attached template list is not significant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Stylesheets:
    <p>This tab allows selecting different stylesheets to associate with the design. You can drag and drop stylesheets between the &quot;Available Stylesheets&quot; list and the &quot;Attached Stylesheets&quot; list and to order stylesheets within the attached list. The order of stylesheets within the attached list determines the order that they will be included in the rendered page content for content items of type &quot;Content Page&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Description:
    <p>This tab provides a free form text area where a description of the design, and additional notes can be entered. the description is also useful to other users when deciding to share a design.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Importing Designs</h4>
<p>The Design Manager module is capable of importing XML themes that were exported from CMSMS Design Manager, or from the older CMSMS theme manager. It expands the uploaded XML file, and extracts templates, stylesheets, and other useful information from the file. It also performs some minor transformation on the extracted data to try to adjust for overlapping names, etc.</p>
<p>The import process is divided into a few steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Upload the file:
    <p>This step manages uploading the user selected XML file and validating its contents. This step is vulnerable to PHP limits for file size, memory limits, and time limits for form processing. You might need to increase those limits on overly restricted sites when uploading larger theme files.</p>
    <p>Once the XML file has passed the validation process, it is copied to a temporary location for processing in step 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Step 2: Verification:
    <p>The second step is for verifying and previewing the new design that will be created from the XML file. From here you can display, and edit various aspects of the design or theme.</p>
</ul>
