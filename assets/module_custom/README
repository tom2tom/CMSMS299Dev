This is the parent folder for data which overrides out-of-box module-data. Such data might sometimes be appropriate, e.g. when operating in 'app mode'. Module actions cannot be overridden this way.

Such data must be in a subfolder named the same as the module, and conforming to the standard module-folders structure e.g.
<thisfolder>/modname/lang/en_US.php
and/or
<thisfolder>/modname/lang/ext/whatever.php

Such data must be managed independently. The original module almost certainly knows nothing of it. This means, for example, that module [un]installation takes no account of it.
