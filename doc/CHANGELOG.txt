Version 2.3 - NO NAME SET
----------------------------------
ADMIN USER-FACING CHANGES

extra themes are available, and single-click installable
'services' section in admin menu (for site-content administration, as distinct from page-content, i.e. user-interactive things like ecommerce, forms data)
replacement notifications mechanism
consistent js-initiated dialogs (no more 'native' popups)
displayed images may also be svg, png or fonticon, with svg preferred if present
revised UI for UDT processing (those are now files, not database records) see next item
editing of templates, stylesheets, user-defined-tags by syntax hilighter Ace or CodeMirror
module-specific templates can also be processed via the general template-edit UI (which is no longer driven by DesignManager module)
extra core modules: CoreAdminLogin, CoreTextEditing, AdminLog

BEHIND THE SCENES

enhanced security - latest PHP-password-cache algorithm, better user-input sanitization, login refactored to a module which can be replaced with different security)
replacement database-interface, more tailored to extract performance from MySQL
cache API revised to support caching by anything
multi-mode caching, auto-selectable if suitable PHP capability is present (Predis|Memcached|APCu|YAC|roll-your-own) as alternates to the existing filesystem files
to facilitate autoloading at least, all PHP classes across the CMSMS core (except CMSModule), have been migrated to the CMSMS namespace, and in some cases that merited a rename as well (CMSMS\cms_config BAH!). Until further notice (way in the future, but dev's should migrate soonish) the former classes will continue to work. In some contexts,  PHP can't deal with aliases (e.g. for method type-declarations) so a former class-space/name MUST continue to be used there until adjustments are made.
support namespace 'CMSAsset' for non-core classes added into <siterootpath>/assets/classes and descendants

optional per-page inclusions (e.g. css, js urls/verbatim) for admin-pages and module-actions, to supplement and/or replace template content and CMSModule::GetHeaderHTML(). So e.g. js can be removed from templates, and inserted at page-bottom.
pre-configuration of site-installation parameters
also support installation based on sources in a git repo

INFRASTRUCTURE

Coded for PHP 7.1+, compatible with 7.1.x to 7.3.x (at least).
jQuery 2.2.4 (effective upgrades from 1.x to the current 3.x need to be in two stages, with an intermediate 2.x)
jQuery migrate 1.4.1
jQuery-UI & jQuery-UI-css 1.12.1
support-js (cookies, sortable, uploads etc) latest releases as of 1/9/2018
Smarty 3.1.36
phpmailer 6.1.7
TinyMCE (MicroTiny module) 4.9.5

CONFIG PARAMETERS

new

app_mode - 1 when operating as a web-app i.e. no admin users, maybe no admin console at all
assets_url
content_language - for PHP htmlentities() and html_entity_decode(), default 'xhtml'
deprecations - if this parameter, and also debug, are not empty, deprecation notices will be thrown when something (method, property etc) deprecated is used
develop_mode (formerly developer_mode) - 1 when somebody authorized is working on the site content/operation
menu_cssclass css class to be applied to admin console context menus. Each admin theme should have such class(es)
pr_root_url - protocol-relative root URI
simpletags_path - name of filesystem folder where 'simple-plugin' files are stored, default 'assets-path'/'simple_plugins'

deprecated

assets_dir instead use (longtime-present) assets_path
max_upload_size ignored (php.ini upload_max_filesize value prevails)
output_compression ignored
ssl_image_uploads_url see image_uploads_url
ssl_uploads_url see uploads_url
ssl_url see root_url
startup_mact_processing ignored
use_adodb_lite ignored
use_hierarchy ignored
use_smarty_php_tags ignored
upload_max_filesize ignored (php.ini value prevails)

DEFINES

new

CMS_ASSETS_URL - URL corresponding to CMS_ASSETS_PATH
CMS_FILETAGS_PATH - filesystem path of folder containing simple-plugin files
CMS_SCRIPTS_PATH - filesystem path of top folder containing js resource files
CMS_SCRIPTS_URL - URL corresponding to CMS_SCRIPTS_PATH

PLUGINS

new

add_footcontent
add_headcontent
assets_url
cms_queue_css
cms_render_css
cms_queue_script
cms_render_scripts
disable_template
edit_template
gather_content
get_jquery
send_content_notice
scripts_url
syntax_area
tabs_restart
theme_root

NOTE: The 'main' function in each function-type plugin takes 2 arguments, like
   smarty_function_my_name($params, $smarty-object)
That 2nd parameter (whatever named) will be a Smarty Internal Template-class object, and (for smarty 3.1.32+) MUST NOT BE A REFERENCE to such obect.

To access the main Smarty class: $smarty-object->smarty

The main function name MUST NOT include a qualifier before the plugin type, like smarty[stuff]_xxxxx e.g. smarty_cms_xxxxx. Current smarty cannot process such.
(Not to be confused with e.g. smarty_function_cms_xxxxx.)

deprecated

cms_jquery  see  get_jquery
cms_stylesheet  media parameter is deprecated

changed

current_date  if no format is given, site-preference 'defaultdateformat' is used

LOCATIONS

deprecated

non-core modules in <siterootpath>/modules
  migrated to <siterootpath>/assets/modules (or whatever the 'assets' folder is named)
javascript files in <siterootpath>/lib/jquery
  jQuery & cmsms core scripts migrated to <siterootpath>/lib/js, other scripts to <siterootpath>/assets/js (or whatever the 'assets' folder is named)
  links to relocated non-jquery files remain in <siterootpath>/lib/jquery
smarty templates, stylesheets, UDT's can be stored as standalone files instead of database records. The location and type of storage is transparent to the user.

INSTALLER

build-parameters are read from a .ini file
one such parameter prescribes installer files form: zip (default) tar.bz2 tar.gz tar (intended for further manipulation by system commands)
symlinks in the source-files are handled properly
user-inputs required during an installer session can be pre-defined in a .ini fle. With all of them in place, an installer session takes only about 90 seconds.
non-core modules can also be included by the release-builder among installer source-files, in which case those modules become optional selections during installation
a custom 'support-url' can be specified, in which case it will be displayed in the admin console instead of a link to CMSMS website
installs and upgrades support renamed admin and/or assets and/or simple_plugins folders
installer can operate on a host without PHP's phar extension
installer cleans up after itself

deprecated

Smarty2 API - e.g. method assign_by_ref() migrates to assignByRef() see https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/blob/master/libs/SmartyBC.class.php
adodb-lite database-interface API
page-element creation via the module-class API (CreateInput...() and the like) - use CMSMS\FormUtils-class (aka CmsFormUtils-class) API
page-tab functions via the Admintheme classes - use CMSMS\AdminTabs-class (aka cms_admin_tabs-class) API
most of the page-tab functions in the module-class - same replacement as previous point
some individual methods scattered across various classes - refer to API documentation
module-related classes & interfaces without suitable namespace
css styling using the '960 Grid System' - migrate to cssgrid with fallback to flexbox

  - CHANGE: Pages-content is cached in the global cache. The redundant ContentCache class is gone
  - CHANGE: Adds convenience methods get_cliuser()
  - CHANGE: Adds the new pr_root_url config entry.  Returns the protocol relative root URI. root_url will always include the protocol.
  - CHANGE: Remove long deprecated passthru parameters to effect $_REQUEST because of potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Improved error message if there was an error parsing the template (or a duplicate content block).
  - Fixes content blocks, image blocks, module blocks containing whitespace in the name.
  - Minor fix to {cms_filepicker} plugin.
  - Improve the CmsModuleInfo class such that if the module class file is newer it will be loaded.
  - Increase the maxlength attribute for password input boxes in myaccount.

  - FEATURE: Adds a new hook method to the HookManager class to allow returning the first nonempty value.
  - CHANGE: refactor changegroupperm localization technique.
  - CHANGE: CmsApp suports __get(), __set() for recording any intra-request property, instead of using PHP global variables
  - FEATURE: Adds new root functions cms_notice, cms_warning, and cms_error
  - FEATURE: Adds new AuditOperations class that is enabled within include.php allows for swapping out auditing methods
    With no audit manager installed, audit messages will be output to the HTTP error log.
  - Revise many places where audit() was being called to call the new methods.
  - audit() method now uses the AuditOperations class
  - CMSModule::SetError() and CMSModule::SetMessage() now set session variables, and the strings will no longer be on the array
  - FEATURE: Adds new CMSModule::AddAdminHeadText() method to allow module actions to add dynamic text to the head section of admin requests.
  - Renames a bunch of classes into namespaces, and cleans up a bunch of old, commented out code.
  - Replaces old "admin log" functionality with a new core module that has extra functionality.
  - CHANGE: Refactor mact processing.  get rid of un-necessary variables and duplicated code.
  - CHANGE: Autoloader will now try to load modules.  Modules can still only be instantiated once.
  - Improved autoloader now handles namespaced module classes if the module is already loaded.
  - FEATURE: Adds new CmsError400Exception class.
  - Improve exception handling in include.php to handle when showtemplate is false.
  - CHANGE:
    - Deprecate undocumented request-parameter [$actionid]showtemplate, which has been used to suppress output.
      Instead use (defined) CMS_JOB_KEY parameter with value
      0 - default, normal page creation & display
      1 - process request with smarty support, but don't display anything, intended for ajax-requests & the like (no page-headers sent)
      2 - process request with minimal overhead (e.g. no smarty reduces request by 50%), for requests which 'do' something rather than display e.g. webhooks, async jobs (no page-headers sent)
  - DEPRECATED: Members 'id','returnid','action' in the $params array defined for module actions (corresponding variables incl. $name are defined).
  - CHANGE: Only modules that are not marked as lazy load (the default) will be loaded automatically during each request.
  - BREAKING: Current Smarty recognizes plugin functions named like smarty_xxx, but not smarty_cms_xxx. Existing plugins are cleaned up during upgrade.
  - BREAKING: Some edge-cases require an explicit 'nocache' parameter in page or template tags.
     We've seen problems with some (not all) instances like {block}{$X={Y}}{/block}.
     Arguably a smarty bug, can be generally cured by disabling caching, but that's tail-wag-dog, very slow.
     In the example, {block}{$X={Y nocache}}{/block} works just fine.
  - Optimize the cms_route_manager for performance
  - FEATURE: Adds ModuleOperations::is_module_loaded() method
    The constructor is sent the module, the actionid and returnid parameters
    The invoke method is sent an array of parameters.
  - FEATURE: Adds mechanism to spoof module actions instead of creating new ones, by calling a method instead of running the action per se.
     Protected method CMSModule::get_controller() identifies such callable (if any) for an action.
  - FEATURE: Allow loading action controller classes with the name Module/Controllers/<action>_action
  - REMOVE: file content.functions.php (last remaining function moved to page.functions.php)
  - Refactor the cms_module_plugin function for performance).
  - Refactor the route-lookup functionality for performance.
  - FEATURE: The database connection class now accepts a single scalar for an argument when only one parameter is required in functions like GetOne()
  - FEATURE: Field definitions for database table creation|modification are more flexible.
      In addition to sized varchar and integer fields, also text and blob e.g. C(255), I(4), T(1024), X(16383)
      Field definition parameters pass through, so extras like UNSIGNED, FIRST, AFTER fieldname, COLLATION type, FOREIGN KEY details, ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP etc are viable.
  - CHANGE: Remove the startup_mact_processing config entry, which controlled the stage, during page-rendering, when the default content block is processed.
  - FEATURE: Adds the {disable_template} plugin.
  - All module actions (except for showtemplate=false or other similar requests) create a new smarty template object
    and destroy it when the action is complete.   This allows ProcessTemplateFromDatabase and ProcessTemplate and other related methods to be un-deprecated.
  - CHANGE: Convert admin passwords to use PHP's builtin password_hash and password_verify methods.
    - Still backwards compatible with older style for upgrades and resetting lost passwords.
    - Users upgrading from very old versions may have to reset passwords
  - FEATURE: Adds site-setting for smarty (frontend) cache lifetime.
  - CHANGE: smarty template directories for admin requests include /assets/templates.
  - Allow svg files to be cached and deflated in the sample htaccess.txt file
  - CHANGE: Now call InitializeFrontend() and InitializeAdmin() from within ModuleOperations::_load_module() on success.  instead of the module constructor.
  - CHANGE: Now call SetParameters from within ModuleOperations::_load_module() and not from the constructor.
  - FEATURE: Adds new {theme_root} plugin for admin templates
  - FEATURE: Adds new {admin_headtext} block plugin for admin templates
  - CHANGE: Module actions can now return output rather than echoing it.
  - Allow login via a module (CoreAdminLogin) now is core admin module
  - FEATURE: Adds a new hook for password strength
  - cms_mailer class now throws an exception if attempting to send an email without setting preferences first.
  - DEPRECATED: sequence-tables additional_users, event_handlers, events, group_perms and their use for populating related tables. In future, autoincrement values
  - BREAKING: New methods and minor cleanup to admin themes (may introduce some breakage)
  - FEATURE: Adds {cms_queue_script} and {cms_render_scripts} plugins to allow combining javascripts and rendering them in fewer requests.
  - FEATURE: new Core::PreProcessScripts and Core::PostProcessScripts hooks
  - FEATURE: new Core::OnCacheClear hook when CMSMS clears the cache
  - BREAKING (possibly, pending 'migration'): Upgrade the system jquery and jquery-ui scripts.
    - some admin side javascript that relies on very old jquery may need changing
  - FEATURE: When using {cms_render_scripts} adds the ability to put inline javascript into <script type="text/cms_javascript">...</script>
    - javascript in these tags will be deferred loaded.
  - CHANGE: Fix lib/nls files so that UTF-8 locales are searched first.
  - FEATURE: cms_admin_utils::get_icon() and {admin_icon} can now find icons without specifying an extension.
  - SECURITY: checksum verification can no longer fish for files outside of the root directory.
  - Improvement to contentoperations::SetDefaultContent()
  - Improve input checking to cms_ipmatches.
  - FEATURE: Adds the cmsfile: smarty resource which is similar to the file resource but more restrictive
     (templates must exist BELOW one of the allowed template directories).  This resource also supports the ;top ;head and ;body
     suffixes to allow parsing a subset of the template.
  - FEATURE: The cmsfile: resource is now the default resource (instead of file:)
  - FEATURE: Now allow loading a page template directly from a smarty resource.
  - FEATURE: Adds new config entry $config['page_template_list'] to allow manually creating a page template list of smarty
      resources:. When enabled, and adding or editing content no design selection is possible, and this list will be displayed.
      Note: when using this, implementing {cms_stylesheet} in the file based templates will be problematic.
  - IMPROVE: Organize and refactor the template parsing code.
  - FEATURE: Added the ability to stop processing content, via an exception.  This is useful in situations where output is retrieved from a cache.
  - FEATURE: Added the {content_text} plugin to allow adding simple static text instructions for editors on the edit content page.
      text must be hardcoded.  i.e {content_text text='This is a test'}
  - FEATURE: Added the {assets_url} plugin to provide the complete URL to the assets folder.
  - FEATURE: New cleaned up simplex theme on initial install demonstrates template inheritance and other techniques
  - FEATURE: New default content on initial install
  - CHANGE: in HookManager::do_hook now smartly handle hook handlers that return null or no result, or single parameters
  - FEATURE: {cms_textarea} now supports the readonly and disabled attributes.
  - CHANGE: Remove redundant returnid parameter from mact url's
  - IMPROVE: {content_image} now allows alt="".
  - IMPROVE: {cms_action_url} will now use the default content page for frontend links IF a returnid is not specified or cannot be inferred
  - IMPROVE: get_page_id_or_alias_from_url() can now throw an exception and improve the way that parameters are merged and cleaned.
  - CHANGE:  RestrictUnknownParams is now OFF by default, AND cleaning is only done if RestrictUnknownParams() is enabled
  - CHANGE: Experiment - all active modules' Initialize*() method is called during each request, regardless of modules' 'load-laziness'
  - FEATURE: You can now pass :NOPRETTY: as a value for the prettyurl parameter in create_url (and CreateLink and CreateFrontendLink) to disable
      pretty url determiniation.
  - FEATURE: cms_action_url plugin now supports the 'alias' parameter.
