This is the parent folder for data which overrides out-of-box admin-data. Such data might sometimes be appropriate, e.g. when operating in 'app mode'.

Such data must be in a subfolder conforming to the corresponding admin-folder structure e.g.
<thisfolder>/lang/en_US.php
and/or
<thisfolder>/lang/ext/whatever.php
