<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This document describes the CMSMS Content Manager module. It is aimed primarily at website designers and developers, and describes in broad terms how content items work in CMS Made Simple.</p>
<p>The primary interface of this module is the content list. It displays content items in a tabular format and provides the ability to quickly search, navigate, and manage multiple content items. This is a dynamic list. The display is adjusted depending on some site configuration items, some global settings, user permissions and the individual content items. The following text describes what content items are, and how the content list behaves with them.</p>
<h3>Content Hierarchy and Navigations</h3>
<p>CMS Made Simple builds frontend navigations dynamically from the content list, the individual types of content items, the content in those content items, and the navigation template. The organization of navigations is primarily controlled by the parent-child/hierarchy relationship of your content items. Starting from the top <em>(root)</em> level, downwards.</p>
<p>Adding a new item to the navigation menu is as simple as creating a new content item, placing it in the desired location in the hierarchy, and <em>(depending upon the content item type)</em> specifying the different properties that that content item type provides.</p>
<h3>Content Item Types:</h3>
<p>CMSMS is distributed with several different content item types <em>(and more are available via independently-developed modules)</em>. These content item types serve different purposes when a navigation is generated. Some do not contain content, but are only used for managing navigations. For example, the separator content item type has no content of its own, and exists solely to organize content items and provide a visible separator in the generated navigation.</p>
<p>Below is a brief description of each content item type that is distributed with CMS Made Simple</p>
<ul>
 <li>Content Page
  <p>This content item type is most similar to an HTML page, and is usually used for that purpose. When editors create content page items they select a design and template which controls the appearance of the page, specify a title, and enter the content for the page.</p>
  <p>Content items may also contain forms, logic, display dynamic data from modules, or User Defined Tags (UDTs). This flexibility allows creating specialized applications, or extremely flexible and dynamic websites.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Link
  <p>This content item type is used in navigations to generate a link to a page on an external website.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Page Link
  <p>This content item type is also used in navigations. It generates a secondary link to an existing content page. This content item type can be used if a content item can be accessed from multiple places in the navigation.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Separator
  <p>This content item type is also used in navigations. It is usually used to generate a horizontal (or vertical) divider between navigation items. Some types of navigations <em>(determined by the navigation template)</em> might not display separators at all.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Section Header
  <p>The section header is also only displayed in navigations. It is used to organize content items. It provides a textual header above, or between other content items. Section headers do not have URLS and cannot usually be clicked on. Some navigation templates might style section headers differently than other content items.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Error Page
  <p>The Error Page is a special type of content item type. It is used when a user attempts to navigate to a content item that is either not navigable or does not exist.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>There are externally-developed modules which provide more content types to serve different purposes, such as displaying catalogues of products, or restricting the content to authorized users.</p>
<h3>The Content Item List</h3>
<p>The content list is the primary interface to the module. This form provides the main management interface for your content. From here you can create, edit, delete, copy, deactivate, and organize your content items. This screen is heavily optimized for larger websites providing pagination and search mechanisms to display only a small amount of pages at a time, but to quickly find items to manage.</p>
<h4>Columns</h4>
<p>Each content item is displayed as a row in a table. There are a number of columns to quickly display various attributes of each content item, and some convenient action icons. Some columns might be hidden from view entirely, or only for some rows depending upon a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Your Access Permissions and Page Ownership:
  <p>If your account is restricted to certain permissions some columns might not be displayed, or might be disabled.</p>
 </li>
 <li>System Preferences and Site Configuration
  <p>Some system preferences, and site configuration options will result in some columns from being disabled. For example, the &quot;url&quot; column </p>
 </li>
 <li>The content item type
  <p>Depending on the content item type, certain columns might become irrelevant. For example, it is not possible for &quot;Section Headers&quot; or &quot;Separators&quot; to become the default page, so nothing will be displayed in the &quot;default&quot; column for those content items.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Whether the content item is being edited
  <p>When other users <em>(or even yourself) are editing a content item, some columns will be hidden in the row for each content type to prevent modifying, deleting or copying the content page.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5>Column List</h5>
   <p>The Content Manager module provides a flexible mechanism for hiding and showing different columns in the content list. Additionally, some columns might be hidden based on the site configuration. For example, the URL column is hidden if pretty <em>(Search Engine Friendly)</em> URLS are not configured.</p>
  <p>Each column in the content list display has a special purpose:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Expand/Collapse Column
    <p>When a content item has children this column will be filled with an icon that allows expanding the list to show the item children, or collapsing the list to hide them. The state of which items are expanded, and which are collapsed is saved on a per-user basis. So that when you revisit the content manager the expanded/collapsed state of your pages will remain the same.</p>
   </li>

   <li>Hierarchy Column
    <p>The hierarchy column displays the location of each content item in the hierarchy in a numeric fashion. The hierarchy of the first root level page begins with 1 and increases incrementally for each peer. Each child begins with the 1, and its peers increment incrementally. Therefore, the second grandchild of the third child of the first item in the content list would have a hierarchy of 1.3.2.</p>
    <p>The hierarchy mechanism is a significant portion of what provides the ability of CMSMS Content Manager to organize content items, and then build navigations from them.</p>
   </li>

   <li>Page Title / Menu Text Column
    <p>This column can either display the page title, or the page menu text. This depends on a setting in the &quot;Site Admin &raquo; Content Manager Settings&quot; page.</p>
    <p>This column will contain a link to allow editing the content item <em>(unless the content item is locked)</em>. Hovering over the text in this column will display additional information about the content item such as the unique numeric content id, and whether the page is cachable or not.</p>
    <p>If the content item is locked, hovering over the text in the column will display information about who locked the item, and when the lock expires.</p>
   </li>

   <li>URL Column
    <p>If enabled, this column will display any alternate URL for this content item. <em>(Note: Only certain content item types support alternate an alternate URL).</em></p>
   </li>

   <li>Page Alias Column
    <p>This column displays the unique alias associated with each page. Aliases are text strings that uniquely identify the content item. You use the content items alias (or numeric id) when you need to refer to a page within the system.<em>(Note: Some content types do not have aliases).</em></p>
   </li>

   <li>Template Column
    <p>This column displays the design and template that is used to display the content for the item. See the help for the &quot;Design Manager&quot; module for an explanation of how CMSMS manages designs, including stylesheets and templates. <em>(Note: Some content item types do not use a design, or a template.)</em></p>
   </li>

   <li>Type Column
    <p>This column indicates the content type (i.e: Content, Section header, Separator, etc.).
     <p>
   </li>

   <li>Owner Column
    <p>The owner column displays the username of the owner of the content item. Hovering over the text in this column will display information as to when the content item was created and last edited.</p>
   </li>

   <li>Active Column
    <p>This column displays icons to show the current active state of the content item. Active items can be navigated to, and will appear in navigation menus on the frontend. If your user account has sufficient privilege to the content item you can click on the icon to toggle its active state.</p>
   </li>

   <li>Default Column
    <p>This column displays whether the content item is the default page or not. The default content item is the home page for this website. Only some content types allow the content type to be the default.</p>
    <p>If your user account has sufficient privilege, and the content type supports being the default content for the website you can click on the icon to change the default flag to a different page.</p>
   </li>

   <li>The &quot;Move&quot; Column
    <p>Depending upon your access privileges, you might see icons that allow changing the order of the content items with respect to its immediate peers. This is a simple mechanism of quickly re-ordering content items amongst its peers. The &quot;Re-order Pages&quot; option allows reorganizing pages en-mass, and when editing a content item you can quickly assign the item to a different parent.</p>
   </li>

   <li>Action Icons
    <p>Depending on your access privileges, the content type and its current lock state you might see different icons on each content row allowing different functionality:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>View - Open up a new browser window <em>(or tab)</em> and view the content item as your visitors will see it.</li>
     <li>Copy - Copy the content item to a new content item.
      <p>A new content item will be created with a new page title, and alias and you will be presented with the ability to edit the new page.</p>
     </li>
     <li>Delete - Delete the content item
      <p>Depending upon your access privileges, and whether or not the content item has children, the option to delete the content item might be hidden or disabled.</p>
     </li>
     <li>Steal Lock
      <p>For content items that are currently being edited, but for which the lock has expired <em>(the editor has not made a change to the form for a while)</em> this option will allow you to steal the lock.</p>
     </li>
     <li>Bulk operations checkbox
      <p>The bulk operations checkbox allows selecting multiple content items to operate on en-mass.</p>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Edit Ability</h4>
  <p>The ability to edit a content item is determined either by permission <em>(see the Manage All Content, and Modify Any Page permissions below)</em>, or by being the owner, or additional editor of a content item.</p>

  <h4>Owners</h4>
  <p>By default, the owner of a content item is the user that initially created it. Owners, or users with &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can give ownership of a page to another user.</p>

  <h4>Additional Editors</h4>
  <p>When editing a content item as an owner or as a user with &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission, the user can select other administrative users, or Admin groups that are also allowed to edit that content item.</p>

  <h4>Relevant Permissions.</h4>
  <p>There are a few permissions that affect what columns are displayed in the content list and the ability to interact with the content list:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Add Pages
    <p>This permission allows users to create new content items. Additionally, users with this permission are able to copy content items that they have edit ability on.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Modify Any Page
    <p>Users with this position will have the ability to edit any content item. It is similar to being an &quot;Additional Editor&quot; on all content items.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Remove Pages
    <p>This permission allows users to remove content items that they have edit ability on. Without this permission, the delete icon on each content item row in the content list will be hidden.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Reorder Pages
    <p>This permission allows users who have edit ability to all siblings of a content item to re-arrange content items amongst their peers.</p>
    <p>i.e: A user in a group who has edit ability to the content item with hierarchy 1.3 and all of its direct siblings <em>(1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc).</em> will be able to re-arrange those items in the navigation. Users without this permission will not see the move up/down icons in listcontent.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Manage All Content
    <p>This permission provides super-user capability on all content items. Users with this permission can add, edit, delete, and re-order any content item. They also have the ability to set the default content item, and perform bulk actions like change ownership that might or might not be available to users with other permissions.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is possible for an Admin user account to not be a member of any groups, and for that Admin user account still have the ability <em>(as an owner or additional editor)</p> to edit some content items.</p>

 <h4>Content Locking</h4>
  <p>Content locking is a mechanism that prevents two editors from editing the same item at the same time, and therefore destroying each others work. Admin users are given exclusive access to a content item until such time as they submit the changes.</p>
  <p>If a content item is locked, you will not be able to edit it until the lock has expired. See below for information on lock expiring. Once a lock has expired, a user will have the option of stealing the lock from the original editor and beginning a new edit session.</p>
  <p>A special icon is displayed on the content item row to indicate that the lock can be stolen.</p>

 <h4>Configuration</h4>
  <p>Some configuration items affect the visibility of certain items in the content list:</p>

 <h4>Other functionality</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Pagination
    <p>The content list can be paginated. This is a performance feature for large sites with a great deal of content items. The default limit is 500 items, however this limit can be lowered by adjusting the value in the options dialogue.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Expand/Collapse All
    <p>These options allow expanding all content items with children so that the children are visible. Or, conversely collapsing all content items with children so that the children are not visible. It is useful to easily find a content item, or to get an overview of the website structure. Each content item with children can still be expanded, or collapsed individually.</p>
   </li>
   <li>Searching
    <p>The &quot;Find&quot; textbox in the top left corner of the content list allows users to quickly and easily find a content item by its title, or menu text. This form uses ajax and autocomplete to display a dropdown list of all items matching the string entered (a minimum of three characters is required).</p>
   </li>
   <li>Bulk Actions
    <p>The &quot;With Selected&quot; form at the bottom right of the content list allows users with appropriate access to modify, or interact with content items en-masse. Numerous options are available (depending both on the selected items, and the users access permission):</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Delete
      <p>This option allows deleting multiple content items (and their children) in few steps. All of the selected content items and their descendants will be analysed for the their eligibility to be deleted. Users will then be prompted with a list of the content items that passed the analysis <em>(if any)</em> and to confirm the action.</p>
  <p>Only users with the permission to remove pages and modify any page, or Manage All Content can use this option.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong>Selecting many content items, or content items with many descendants, can be very memory- and database-intensive, and slow.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Active
  <p>This option will ensure that the content items selected are marked as &quot;Active&quot;. Users will be asked to confirm the operation. This operation does not work on descendent of the selected pages.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Inactive
  <p>this option analyses the selected items for eligibility, and will set all of the eligible content items to inactive. Inactive pages cannot be navigated to, and might break a working website. The default page cannot be set to inactive.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Cachable
  <p>This option sets the selected content items to &quoc;cachable&quot;. This might have different effects based on the site configuration:
   <p>
    <p>If enabled in &quot;Site Admin >> Global Settings&quot;, content items marked as &quot;cachable&quot; can be cached by the browser <em>(this reduces load on your webserver for users visiting the same page frequently).</em>
     <p>Also in &quot;Site Admin >> Global Settings&quot; Smarty caching effects cachable pages. This is an advanced tool that will cache the generated html code of a for repeated use, and can dramatically reduce server load and improve performance. However, it is an advanced topic and might negatively the dynamic nature of some content items.</p>
     <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Not Cachable
  <p>This option ensures that the selected content items are not cachable.
   <p>
 </li>
 <li>Show In Menu
  <p>This option ensures that the selected content items are visible in frontend navigation menus.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Hide From Menu
  <p>This option ensures that the selected content items will not be visible (by default) in frontend navigation menus. Various options of navigation generation modules might override the &quot;Show In Menu&quot; setting.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Secure (HTTPS)
  <p>This option will ensure that HTTPS will be used when the selected content items are displayed.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You might need to adjust the secure URL settings in the CMSMS config.php file, and to contact your host about proper SSL configuration.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Insecure (HTTP)
  <p>This option removes the HTTPS flag from the selected content items.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Content items without the secure <em>(HTTPS)</em> might still be accessed via the HTTPS protocol.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Design & Template
  <p>This option will display a form to set the design and template that are associated with the selected content items. Only some content item types have a design and template association. i.e: the &quot;content&quot; item type, and those provided by other modules that provide similar functionality.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Set Owner
  <p>This option displays a form that allows changing the ownership of the selected content items.</p>
  <p>Only users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission can use this option.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reordering
 <p>Users with the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission have the ability to re-organize content items en-masse by selecting the &quot;Reorder Pages&quot; item from the options menu on the content list display. This provides a form where content items can be re-ordered with simple drag and drop operations.</p>
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> This can be a very memory and database intensive operation, and we do not suggest using this option on websites with more than a few hundred content items.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding and Editing Content Items</h3>
<p>The ability to add content items depends on having either the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission, or the &quot;Add Pages&quot; permission. Users with &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission will be able to manage all aspects of the content item. Users without this permission will have considerably less abilities.</p>
<p>The add (or edit) content page form is divided into numerous tabs; numerous properties of the content item will appear on different tabs. The list of tabs that are visible, and the &quot;properties&quot; on those tabs is influenced by numerous factors:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The content item type
  <p>Some content item types (such as separators and section headers) do not require much information, therefore very few tabs and properties will be displayed.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Your permission level
  <p>If your user account does not have the &quot;Manage All Content&quot; permission level, then you are only permitted to manage <em>(by default)</em> the basic properties of the content item. Enough to edit content, and pick a page in its navigation. You might also be restricted as to where new content items can be placed in the content hierarchy.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Site settings <em>(i.e.: the &quot;Basic Properties&quot; field in the &quot;Global Settings&quot; window, and others)</em>.
  <p>Some site settings <em>(and even config settings)</em> can influence what properties are displayed on what tab. The &quot;Basic Properties&quot; setting in the &quot;Site Admin >> Global Settings&quot; page extends the list of content item properties that users with restricted permissions can edit.</p>
 </li>
 <li>The template that has been selected.
  <p>Tags in templates define additional properties <em>(called content blocks)</em> that authorized users can edit when editing a content item that uses that templates. These content blocks can be plain text areas, WYSIWYG test areas, image selectors, or other items. Template developers can specify the tab that the edit field for each content block appears on.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>Here we will briefly describe the common properties for the &quot;Content&quot; content item type. Some content item types use significantly fewer properties, and some content types supplied by independently-develped modules might behave completely differently.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Title
  <p>This field describes the title for the content item (if applicable). The title is usually displayed in the &lt;title&gt; tag in the HTML page head, and somewhere in a prominent place in the HTML page content. The site developer has complete control over how this data is used or displayed.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Alias
  <p>The page alias is a string that uniquely identifies this content item, and is usually easier to remember than the integer page id. The alias is used in numerous locations when building CMSMS website. It can be used to create links to content items, to build specialized navigations, or as behavioral hints to other modules indicating on what content item they should display data.</p>
  <p>By default the page alias is uniquely generated from the title when adding a new content item, however users can specify their own page alias when adding or editing the content item so long as it is unique amongst all other content items. Some content item types do not require a page alias.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to specify the alias when adding or editing a content item.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Parent
  <p>The parent property specifies the content item that is the immediate parent of the content item being edited in the content hierarchy. Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to edit this property, or might have a restricted list of options for this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Content
  <p>Each page template is required to include at least the default content property <em>(a.k.a block)</em>. However they can define many more, and different types of content blocks. The default block usually appears in the edit content form as a wWYSIWYG enabled text area allowing the editor to specify some default content for the page.</p>
  <p>Site developers have significant control over the tab that this is displayed in, the label, maxlength, required, and other attributes to control the behavior of this property in the edit form, and when it is displayed.</p>
  <p>If the WYSIWYG editor is enabled for this content block and content item <em>(see below)</em>, and one or more WYSIWYG editor modules are enabled, and the user has selected a WYSIWYG editor in his preferences then a WYSIWYG editor will be displayed. Different WYSIWYG editors have different abilities, but most provide the ability to format text in different ways. Additionally, most WYSIWYG editors allow inserting images and creating links to other content items in this website.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Menu Text
  <p>This property is used when building navigations. The contents of this field are used as the text to display for this content item in the navigation.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Show in Menu
  <p>Often, it is useful to have content items for special purposes (such as to display sitemaps, search results, login forms, etc.) that are not displayed <em>(by default)</em> in navigation menus. This property allows each content item to be hidden from navigation items unless overridden elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Title Attribute
  <p>This property defines an optional text string that can be used to display additional information for the content item in the navigation. It is typically used in the &quot;title&quot; attribute for the link that is generated in navigation menus.</p>
  <p>The site developer has the ability to display this data differently, or ignore it completely by modifying the appropriate navigation menu template. Additionally, this data can be displayed in the page content by modifying the appropriate page template. This property might not be important for content items in this website.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Access Key
  <p>This property defines an optional access key character <em>usually only one or two characters</em> that can be used in navigation menus to quickly access this content item in the navigation. This is a useful feature when building accessible navigations.</p>
  <p>The site developer has complete ability to include, or exclude the use of this property in his navigation templates. And it might not be required for this website.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Tab Index
  <p>This property is used to specify an integer index to aide in navigation to this content item in menus. It is useful when creating accessible websites.</p>
  <p>The site developer has complete ability to include, or exclude the use of this property in his navigation templates. And it might not be required for this website.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Target
  <p>This property is used to specify the &quot;target&quot; attribute in links to content items. It allows creating navigations that can open content pages in different browser windows or tabs.</p>
  <p>The site developer has complete ability to include, or exclude the use of this property in his navigation templates. And it might not be required for this website.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Url
  <p>This property is used to specify a primary URL to this content item. Users can specify a complete path or a simple flat string. <em>(i.e.: path/to/mypage or keywordstuffedpageurl)</em>. This property (if specified) is used when building navigations and other links to this content item, when &quot;pretty urls&quot; are enabled in the config.php. If not specified, then the page alias and other settings control the primary route to the content item.</p>
  <p>It is important to note for SEO purposes that this is only a primary URL <em>(route)</em> to the content items. Site visitors can still navigate to this content item via other means, i.e: mysite.com/index.php?page=alias or mysite.com/random/random/alias or mysite.com/alias. Sites that are concerned with search engine rankings should ensure that the &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt; tag is properly configured in their page templates.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Active <em>(i.e: disabled)</em>
  <p>This property is used to indicate whether this content item can be navigated to at all.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Secure (HTTPS)
  <p>This property is used to indicate whether this content item should be accessed using the HTTPS protocol. In a site configured properly for HTTPS, if this attribute is set for a content item, and an attempt is made to access this page via the insecure HTTP protocol, the user will be redirected to the same page using the more secure HTTPS protocol. Additionally, if this flag is set then any links to this content item will specify the HTTPS protocol.</p>
  <p>It is important to know that content items without the secure flag set can still be navigated to using the HTTPS protocol, and no redirection will take place. Therefore, for search engine ranking purposes the canonical link should be configured properly in each page template.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Cachable
  <p>This property specifies whether the compiled form of this content item can be cached on the server to reduce server load <em>(if smarty caching is enabled in global settings)</em> AND whether the browser can cache this page <em>(if browser caching is enabled in global settings)</em>. For largely static websites enabling smarty caching and browser caching can significantly reduce server load and improve overall website performance.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Image
  <p>This property allows associating a previously uploaded image with your this content item. Editors can select an image file from the uploads/images directory. This image might be displayed on the generated HTML page (if applicable), or used when building the navigation.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Thumbnail
  <p>This property allows associating a previously created thumbnail image with this content item. Editors can select a thumbnail file from the uploads/images directory. This thumbnail might be displayed on the generated HTMLO page, or used when building the navigation.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Owner
  <p>The owner property is a dropdown field that indicates which admin user account has primary responsibility for the content item. By default the owner of the content item is the user who first created it. Users with significant permission can assign the ownership of an item to another user.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Additional Editors
  <p>This property specifies a list of other admin users or admin groups that are allowed to edit this content item. It is implemented as a multi-select field. Again, users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Design
  <p>The property allows associating a design with the content item. A design is used to determine the stylesheets and other items that contribute to the appearance of content items. The design is associated with different templates. Changing the design property might result in the template property automatically changing. By default the &quot;default design&quot; selected in the Design Manager is selected here. Some restricted editors might not have the ability to adjust this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Template
  <p>The page template property is used to determine the overall layout of the content item (for those content items that generate HTML). It also determines the use of meta tags and content blocks. Changing this template will refresh the page and display the appropriate content properties (blocks) that are specified in the newly selected template.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Searchable
  <p>This property controls whether the content properties on this content item can be indexed by the search module.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Disable WYSIWYG
  <p>This property will disable the WYSIWYG editor for all content blocks on this content item. This overrides all settings on the content blocks, and any user setting. This is useful for content items that contain pure logic in the content blocks, or strictly call other modules. This prevents the logic or output from the modules from being effected by the styling injected by the WYSIWYG.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Page Metadata
  <p>The primary purpose of this property is for injecting meta properties into the &lt;head&gt; section of the rendered HTML page. Typically it is useful for injecting a meta description tag.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Page Data
  <p>This property is primarily used for inserting data, or logic into the smarty process for use by the page template. It is an advanced field for usage in flexible layouts that change their behavior dynamically.</p>
  <p>Users with restricted permissions might not have the ability to adjust or specify this property.</p>
 </li>

 <li>extra1, extra2, and extra3</li>
 <p>Additional properties for use in either displaying data, or influencing the behavior of the page template.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
