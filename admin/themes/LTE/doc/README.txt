OneEleven Theme is a simplistic and hopefully easy to use theme for CMS Made Simple.
Theme inspiration comes from popular systems as well as NCleanGrey Admin theme.
There are already enough themes for CMSMS that come with a horizontal navigation so this time my choice was to choose a alternative.

Theme was done in HTML5 and an attempt was taken to create it in a responsive manner to some level.
This means that you should be able to easily use it on your mobile devices to some level.

Have fun using it!
